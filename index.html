          FOX one day fell into a deep well and could find no means of escape.
    A Goat, overcome with thirst, came to the same well, and seeing the Fox,
    inquired if the water was good. Concealing his sad plight under a merry
    guise, the Fox indulged in a lavish praise of the water, saying it was
    excellent beyond measure, and encouraging him to descend. The Goat,
    mindful only of his thirst, thoughtlessly jumped down, but just as he
    drank, the Fox informed him of the difficulty they were both in and
    suggested a scheme for their common escape. “If,” said he, “you will
    place your forefeet upon the wall and bend your head, I will run up your
    back and escape, and will help you out afterwards.” The Goat readily
    assented and the Fox leaped upon his back. Steadying himself with the
    Goat’s horns, he safely reached the mouth of the well and made off as
    fast as he could. When the Goat upbraided him for breaking his promise,
    he turned around and cried out, “You foolish old fellow! If you had
    as many brains in your head as you have hairs in your beard, you would
    never have gone down before you had inspected the way up, nor have
    exposed yourself to dangers from which you had no means of escape.”

    <h2>The Bear <br>
      and <br>
      the Two Travelers <br> </h2>
<p>
    <span class="texteBear">TWO MEN were traveling together, when a Bear suddenly met them on their
    path. One of them climbed up quickly into a tree and concealed himself
    in the branches. The other, seeing that he must be attacked, fell flat
    on the ground, and when the Bear came up and felt him with his snout,
    and smelt him all over, he held his breath, and feigned the appearance
    of death as much as he could. The Bear soon left him, for it is said he
    will not touch a dead body. When he was quite gone, the other Traveler
    descended from the tree, and jocularly inquired of his friend what it
    was the Bear had whispered in his ear. “He gave me this advice,” his
    companion replied. “Never travel with a friend who deserts you at the
    approach of danger.”
